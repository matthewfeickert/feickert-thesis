The discovery of a Higgs-like boson~\cite{Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Higgs:1966ev,Englert:1964et,Guralnik:1964eu} at CERN in 2012 by the \Gls{ATLAS} and CMS collaborations~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj} was a major triumph for both theoretical and experimental particle physics.
However, work remained to verify the properties of the new particle and to test if the predictions of the standard model (SM) would be in agreement with the observations of Nature.
