 Dijet search contours for $95\%$ CL upper limits on the coupling $g_{q}$ as a function of the resonance mass $m_{Z'_{A}}$ for the leptophobic axial-vector $Z'_{A}$ model.
 The expected limits from each search are indicated by dotted lines.
 The TLA dijet analysis has two parts, employing different datasets with different selections in the rapidity difference $y^{*}$ as indicated.
 The yellow contour shows the results of the dijet search using $20.3~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $8~\TeV$ data.
 Coupling values above the solid lines are excluded, as long as the signals are narrow enough to be detected using these searches.
 The TLA dijet search with $\abs{y^{*}} < 0.6$ is sensitive up to $\Gamma/m_{Z'} = 7\%$, the TLA dijet with $\abs{y^{*}} < 0.3$ and dijet + ISR searches are sensitive up to $\Gamma/m_{Z'} = 10\%$, and the dijet and dibjet searches are sensitive up to $\Gamma/m_{Z'} = 15\%$.
 The dijet angular analysis is sensitive up to $\Gamma/m_{Z'} = 50\%$.
 No limitation in sensitivity arises from large width resonances in the $t\bar{t}$ resonance analysis.
 Benchmark width lines are indicated in the canvas.
 The $\Gamma/m_{Z'} = 50\%$ lies beyond the canvas borders~\cite{Zprime_gq_limit_public_plot}.}

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:systematic_uncertainties}

The impact of a systematic uncertainty is defined as the difference in quadrature between the uncertainty in $\mu$ computed when all other uncertainties are considered and when they are fixed to their pre-fit values.
The total systematic uncertainty is then defined as the difference in quadrature between the total uncertainty in $\mu$ and the total statistical uncertainty~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-052}.
The systematic uncertainties and their impacts on the measurement of the signal strengths are summarized in \Cref{table:systematic_uncertainties}.

  Summary of the impact $(\sqrt{\Delta \sigma^2}/\mu)$ of the main systematic uncertainties on the uncertainty, $\sigma$, on the measurement of the signal strength, $\mu$, for the $\Vjets$, Higgs boson and $\Zprime$ signals~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-052}.}
