\chapter{Noether's Theorem}\label{appendix:Noethers_theorem}

Emmy Noether's mathematical contributions are perhaps most well known for her groundbreaking work in algebra~\textcolor{red}{CITATION NEEDED}.
However, her impact in physics is greatest through her theorem of the conservation currents that arise through mathematical symmetries --- what is now called ``Noether's Theorem''.
What follows is a brief introduction of Noether's Theorem, a summary of its importance and use in high energy physics, and a few poignant examples.
