# Thesis Resources

While writing this thesis I came across, and had shared with me, resources that proved to be highly valuable. In hopes of sharing these resources and potentially saving some future Ph.D. candidate a few precious hours during their writing period I've collected some of them as a listing here.

## Figures

- [Every figure in _The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider_ in an EPS or PDF format](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/AtlasTechnicalPaperListOfFigures)
   - [_The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider_, JINST 3 (2008) S08003](http://inspirehep.net/record/796888)
- [Every figure in the PDG in an EPS file format](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/figures/figures.html)
   - The above link is for the 2018 edition of _Review of Particle Physics_, but the most recent version can be found from the [PDG homepage](http://pdg.lbl.gov/index.html) by clicking the "Figures in reviews" link

## LaTeX

- [Docker image built from Ubuntu containing latest version of TeX Live](https://hub.docker.com/r/matthewfeickert/latex-docker/)
   - This image powered the CI for my thesis and built the full document with each push to GitHub
