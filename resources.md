# Thesis Resources

While writing this thesis I came across, and had shared with me, resources that proved to be highly valuable. In hopes of sharing these resources and potentially saving some future Ph.D. candidate a few precious hours during their writing period I've collected some of them as a listing here.

## Figures

- [Every figure in _The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider_ in an EPS or PDF format](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/AtlasTechnicalPaperListOfFigures)
   - [_The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider_, JINST 3 (2008) S08003](http://inspirehep.net/record/796888)
- [Every figure in the PDG in an EPS file format](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/figures/figures.html)
   - The above link is for the 2018 edition of _Review of Particle Physics_, but the most recent version can be found from the [PDG homepage](http://pdg.lbl.gov/index.html) by clicking the "Figures in reviews" link
- Every figure in any ATLAS publication is publicly available as an isolated image file. To find a figure, go to the [ATLAS Experiment public results page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic), find the publication the figure appears in, then click the "Documents" link in the "Links" column. This will take you to a webpage for the publication that lists all figures with links to them.
   - Example: My thesis analysis [ATLAS-CONF-2018-052](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2018-052)

## LaTeX

- [Docker image built from Ubuntu containing latest version of TeX Live](https://hub.docker.com/r/matthewfeickert/latex-docker/)
   - This image powered the CI for my thesis and built the full document with each push to GitHub
- [Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com/) allows for very fast and accurate LaTeX code extraction from screenshots of equations

## Writing

- [How to Write a Thesis, According to Umberto Eco](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/umberto-eco-how-to-write-a-thesis/) - The MIT Press Reader

## Revising

While making comments on my thesis for me to revise, my advisor would mark the upper left-hand corner of the page with two angled parallel lines along with his revisions.
This was quite helpful as it allowed me to quickly tab through the PDF looking for these indicators, which both sped up the revision process and helped me make sure I didn't miss any small comments.
